# MyCalculator-Groovy
HelloðŸ¥¸ , this is a project to test the Groovy performance for small multi-module projects (i'm using it to compare with Kotlin DSL, this is the [project](https://github.com/PabloProta/MyCalculator-KTS)).

> The project doesn't have any complex ui, is just to test the build performance,
so the main focus wasn't in develop any ui but just setup the project.
